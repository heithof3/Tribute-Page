                        <h3>
                            SGT Jeremy Robbins: 
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            While on a Medical convoy Jeremy’s unit was ambushed. The scary thing was the snippers were firing
                            antitank rounds. One hit the hummer passenger door (most vulnerable spot). The round penetrated & hit his Sargent first
                            before ricocheting hitting the driver, Jeremy’s good friend. The main fragment hit the right side of this head blowing
                            out much of his brain. While under fire Jeremy disembarked & pulled his friend out of the driver seat where he was
                            severely stuck. The pull caused him to fall backwards (both with full metal plates on) with his friend landing on top of
                            him. He was dying, blood everywhere, but while under fire he got his buddy in the follow-up medical van. (Earning him
                            only the Combat Pin). He made the command decision not to call for helicopter evat- support but to run through the
                            ambush & return to the hospital where his friend was saved. Sadly, for the rest of his life his buddy will have to wear
                            a helmet to protect his damaged head. Upon Company deactivation his body’s parents found Jeremy & hugged him for several
                            minutes crying in thanks.
