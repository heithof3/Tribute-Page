                <h2>The Silver Star Medal is the United States Armed Forces' third-highest personal decoration for valor in combat. The
                    Silver Star Medal is awarded primarily to members of the United States Armed Forces for gallantry in action against an
                    enemy of the United States.</h2>

                    <p>Sudden military withdrawals from Afghanistan & Iraq many companies failed (not permitted) to submit paper work for
                        medals earned in combat, generally occurring the last 3-months of service. Like Korean, Vietnam & Desert Strom heroes,
                        will Iraqi freedom & Afghan liberation heroes have to wait 50-years to be recognized themselves? From my perspective my
                        brothers Casey & Jeremy Robbins are worthy of recognition at least equal to the Silver Star): For unconditional valor
                        going above & beyond the call of duty both my brothers saved many lives of Iraqi & fellow soldiers & Iraqi citizens
                        (mostly children). Hereâ€™s my brief of said incidents.</p>
