                        SSG Casey Robbins:
                    </h3>
                                <p>
                            While on one a few last mission, his squad swept an Iraq village for IED’s. Casey squad was standing
                        adjacent a hut with his squad of a dozen men discussing mission protocol when Casey heard his Sargent yell, “Don’t
                        move!” His sergeant was nowhere near his squad reporting he never yelled anything, but Casey heard him loud & clear, as
                        if the Holy Ghost was upon him. He listened to the voice he’s most keen to obey & began looking for a reason for the
                        warning, knowing none of his squad members heard their boss. Right away he noticed something out of the ordinary &
                        yelled for his troops to freeze & not move. This was a strict order & everyone froze, which was a good thing. Casey
                        noticed a white plastic artifact in the sand at the center of the squad. He bent over & uncovered the item & discovered
                        an IED. He subsequently volunteered to defuse the IED, which was tied to several IED’s. Had anyone stepped on it the
                        entire squad & half the village would have been obliterated. (Casey defused the IED’s earning him a Combat Pin, but
                        nothing else). Because Casey’s Bomb unit had to leave right away to another mission & the Iraqi bomb unit wouldn’t
                        arrive for another 8-hours Casey volunteered. The Squad couldn’t leave a live IED in the village with dozens of children
                        playing soccer. Only take one child to step too close & they’d all be dead—Jelly, including their parents.
